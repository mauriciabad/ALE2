## Assignment 1: parse + dfa

### Parsing

For parsing I created the `RawGraph` class, that is a regular JavaScript object with all the information from the input structured.

The class has a constructor that accepts a string.

It parses the information using regex and I made them really carfeully, so that they accept a very wide variety of errors.

#### Accepted input errors

- It **never crashes** when something is missing or wrong.
- Can skip almost any separation character, specially whitespaces spaces and commas.
- The fields `states`, `aphabet` and `stack` are rebundant information, so they are extracted from other places. For example:
  - If you use a state in `transitions` that's not in `states`, it is added.
  - If you have a state in `states` but it not used enywhere else, it doesn't get removed.
  - Both examples work for state names, transition letters and stack letters.
- Statements can be in any order.
- In boolean fiends if it's not: 'y', 'ye', 'yes', 'true', 'tru', 'tr', 't', '1', 'ok' or 'si': it's treated as false.
- Also parses comments.
- In regex, unclosed parenthesis are closes at the end.
- In regex, missing commas are added.
- In regex, consecutive commas are removed.
- In regex, `.` and `|` operators accept any number of arguments, like: `|(a,b,c,d,e,...)`.

All this transitions would be accepted:

```
transitions :
  1 ,  a  2 
1, --> 2 
1, ->  2
1 2 3, a -> 1 2 3
1,a [,] ----> 2
1,a [] > 2
1,a [x] - 2
1,_[xy 2
1,[xy2

end.
```

This are the used regex:

```js
const regxParser = {
  comments: /^ *# *(.*) *$/gm,
  regex: /(regex|re|regexr|regular expression)s? *: *(.*)/i,
  alphabet: /alphabets? *: *(\w*)/i,
  stack: /stacks? *: *(\w*)/i,
  states: /states? *: *((.*)*)/i,
  final: /final *: *((.*)*)/i,
  transitions: /transitions? *: *([^]+?) *end\.?/i,
  transition: /^ *([^\n,\->[\]]+) *,? *(\w?) *(\[ *(\w?) *,? *(\w?) *\]?)? *-*>? *([^\n,\->[\]]*)?/gm,
  dfa: /dfa *: *(\w*)/i,
  finite: /finite *: *(\w*)/i,
  words: /words? *: *([^]+?) *end\.?/i,
  word: /^ *(\w*)[^\w\n]+(\w+)/gm,
};
```

## Evaluate if graph is DFA

### Optimitations

1. My implementation stops whenever the condition can't be satisfied anymore, it doesn't have to keep going until the end.
1. This  value is only evaluated the first time you get the value.
1. Use efficent data structures. In this case a Set.

This is the code:

```js
get isDfa() {
  if (this._isDfa !== undefined) return this._isDfa;
  this._isDfa = this.evalIsDfa();
  return this._isDfa;
}

evalIsDfa() {
  for (const node of this.nodes.values()) {
    const foundLetters = new Set();

    for (const adjacentcy of node.adjacencies) {
      if (foundLetters.has(adjacentcy.label)) return false;
      foundLetters.add(adjacentcy.label);
    }

    if (foundLetters.size !== this.alphabet.size) return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```
