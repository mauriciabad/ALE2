## Assignment 1: Parse + Tree

### General notes

- Describe your approach, detail upon challenges, what were your struggles, how you came across them.
- If you did not manage to implement, also mention all your attempts and why your solution could not be implemented.
- Describe (in existent) additional feature or smart computations that I might miss while assessing your code.
- All team work (2+ students) must be mentioned; e.i.: In class Tree.cs from line 15‐55 is code developed together with partner X (PCN:xxxxxx).
- IMPORTNAT: Please be sure to mention all lines of code you worked together with another fellow student, otherwise plagiarism might be detected in your code and you will be sent to the examination board.
